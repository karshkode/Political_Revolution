**Next Steps**

1. ~Take out any clunky, unused code causing too much weight on file size.~

_NOTE: To paste into subreddit, remove spaces to reduce filesize to under 100kb, otherwise too much adjustment added. Use [CSS Minifier](https://cssminifier.com)_

1. ~Organize CSS into hierarchies~

1. ~Scrap unneeded parts of current theme design. Clean, clean, clean.~

1. ~Update spritesheets and any outdated graphics~

1. ~Update Flair design to accommodate for new ranks~

1. Test ranking with PolRevBot integration for assigning user flairs based on GrassrootsPB DB linkage.

* Query users via Google Form to verify username <-> Reddit username connection? Also used to serve submissions for activism performed.
